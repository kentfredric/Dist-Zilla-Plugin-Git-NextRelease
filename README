NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextRelease - Use time-stamp from Git instead
    of process start time.

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This module acts as a moderately thin wrapper to "[NextRelease]" so that
    the time-stamps produced are generated by asking "git" for the
    time-stamp of the current branch.

    If you always require a specific branch for generating time-stamps, it
    can be specified as a parameter.

        -[NextRelease]
        +[Git::NextRelease]

    Optionally:

        +branch = master

    This exists mostly because of my extensive use of "[Git::CommitBuild]",
    to provide a commit series for both releases, and builds of all
    changes/commits in order to push them to Travis for testing. ( Mostly,
    because testing a build branch is substantially faster than testing a
    master that requires "Dist::Zilla", especially if you're doing "Fresh
    install" testing like I am. )

METHODS
  "section_header"
    This is the sole method of "[NextRelease]" that we override, in order
    for it to inject the right things.

    This method basically returns the date string to append to the Changes
    header.
