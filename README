NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextRelease - Use time-stamp from Git instead
    of process start time.

VERSION
    version 0.002012

SYNOPSIS
    This module acts as a moderately thin wrapper to "[NextRelease]" so that
    the time-stamps produced are generated by asking "git" for the
    time-stamp of the current branch.

    If you always require a specific branch for generating time-stamps, it
    can be specified as a parameter.

        -[NextRelease]
        +[Git::NextRelease]

    Optionally:

        +branch = master

    Or:

        +default_branch = master

    ( The latter only having impact in detached-head conditions )

    This exists mostly because of my extensive use of "[Git::CommitBuild]",
    to provide a commit series for both releases, and builds of all
    changes/commits in order to push them to Travis for testing. ( Mostly,
    because testing a build branch is substantially faster than testing a
    master that requires "Dist::Zilla", especially if you're doing "Fresh
    install" testing like I am. )

METHODS
  "section_header"
    This is the sole method of "[NextRelease]" that we override, in order
    for it to inject the right things.

    This method basically returns the date string to append to the Changes
    header.

ATTRIBUTES
  "branch"
    If set, always use the specified branch to determine time-stamp.

    Default value is resolved from determining "current" branch.

  "default_branch"
    If you want being on a branch to always resolve to that branch, but you
    still want a useful behavior when on a detached head, specifying this
    value means that on a detached head, the stated branch will be used
    instead.
